# Assets Directory

## Channel Logo

Place your channel logo as `channel_logo.png` in this directory.

**Requirements:**
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Recommended size: 100x100px to 200x200px
- The logo will appear in the bottom left corner of all videos
- It will rotate continuously (360° every 3 seconds)

**How to add:**
1. Save your logo image as `channel_logo.png`
2. Place it in this `assets/` directory
3. The video generation will automatically use it

If no custom logo is found, the system will generate a default blue circle with a dollar sign ($).
